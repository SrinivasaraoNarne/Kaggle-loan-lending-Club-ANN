# Kaggle-loan-lending-Club-ANN
This project focuses on predicting loan defaults using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with Keras. The goal is to classify whether a borrower is likely to default based on historical lending data. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
# Overview
Loan default prediction is critical for financial institutions to assess credit risk and manage lending policies effectively. This project leverages a Kaggle dataset and employs deep learning techniques to predict the likelihood of loan defaults based on borrower attributes and loan characteristics.
